# Gaussian-Elimination
A C++ software project that I completed in 2005 for a course at the Milwaukee School of Engineering

How to use:

To use the Gaussian Elimination program, you need to supply it with the name of a text file containing the system of equations.  The format is as follows:

Example system of equations (it works up to nth order, so there is no limit)
a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 = y1
a4x1 + a5x2 + a6x3 = y2
a7x1 + a8x2 + a9x3 = y3

//textfile
# of rows (3 in this case)
# of columns (4 in this case)
a1
a2
a3
y1
a4
a5
a6
y2
a7
a8
a9
y3
